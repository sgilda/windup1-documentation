Within the Windup report, the high level report will show files within archives and the file's classification:

[source,xml]
.https://github.com/windup/windup/blob/master/windup-engine/src/main/resources/windup/java/java-ejb-config.windup.xml[View Rule]
--------------------------
<windup:java-classification 
        source-type="INHERITANCE" 
        regex="javax.ejb.EJBObject$"
        description="EJB 1.x/2.x - Remote Interface" />
--------------------------



A Java file is classified by identifiers in the Java file itself. The Windup engine helps make classifying and putting inline hints in Java files much easier.  With a simple Regular Expression, you can add Java classifications based on characteristics of the Java file.  

[NOTE]
JBoss Windup must blacklist the classes in order to provide Java hints and classifications.  The package blacklist can be found in: `/windup-engine/src/main/resources/jboss-windup-context.xml` within the bean `blacklistedClasses`. The blacklist drives whether the class members are parsed and sent down the pipeline. They all represent regular expressions.  For example, `<value>com.bea</value>` actually blacklists all classes `^com.bea.*`.

6.1.1 Classification Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simple XML below (included in `windup-java-ejb-config.xml`) shows how the Java file depicted above was classified as "EJB 2.x - Local Object".  

[source,xml]
--------------------------
<windup:java-classification source-type="INHERITANCE" regex="javax.ejb.EJBLocalObject$"
        description="EJB 2.x - Local Object" />
--------------------------

6.1.2 Classifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The full schema can be found in the ([windup.xsd](https://github.com/windup/windup/blob/master/src/main/resources/namespace/windup.xsd)). We'll run through the key ones here. Attributes on the Java Classification include:

description (string)::
  the classification to define the Java if the Regex matches
effort (int)::
  number of Story Points to implement estimated changes
regex (regex)::
  regular expression to match against
source-type (enum | optional)::
  filter to apply regex to only certain Java class uses

The Java Classification can also include children tags:

windup:hints::
  described below; provide inline hints to the Windup resource report
windup:decorators::
  described below; provide capability to chain logic

6.1.2.1 Source Type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `source-type` can be:

METHOD::
  regex is only matched against method calls
INHERITANCE::
  regex is only matched and the hint applied against the supertypes of the class
TYPE::
  regexPattern is matched against only variables instances OR annotations
CONSTRUCT::
  regex is matched against only constructor calls
IMPORT::
  regex is matched against only import calls

6.1.2.2 Nested Decorators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Within the `windup:java-classification` tag, users can chain `windup:decorators`.  This allows Windup rules to very easily and efficiently filter rules that need to apply to a given resource. Within the `windup:decorators` tag, users can put any number of  Windup decorators. Take the following example:

[source,xml]
-----------------------
<windup:java-classification source-type="INHERITANCE" regex="org.mule.umo.UMOFilter$" description="Mule ESB Message Filter">
    <windup:decorators>
        <windup:link url="http://camel.apache.org/message-filter.html" description="Camel Message Filter" />
        <windup:link url="http://camel.apache.org/bean-language.html" description="Camel Message Bean Filter" />
    </windup:decorators>
</windup:java-classification>
-----------------------

In ths example, if the Java class inherits from a class matching the regular expression `org.mule.umo.UMOFilter$`, then the Windup engine applies the nested decorators, within `windup:decorators` nested tag.  Essentially in the example above, this links to several articles which would help migration from Mule Message Filter to Camel's Message Filter.

This allows Windup to be efficient by only executing rules that apply to a given classification.  For example, if the Java class is a EJB, you may want to chain other decorators that extract @EJB annotations to extract EJB injection information.  This logic would be better handled by a nested decorator so that it is only applied in cases where an EJB is identified instead of trying to apply it to every class.


6.1.2.3 Nested Hints
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Within the `windup:java-classification` tag, users can chain `windup:hints`.  This allows Windup rules to very easily and efficiently filter rules that need to apply to a given resource. Within the `windup:decorators` tag, users can put any number of Windup hints.

Take the following example:

[source,xml]
-----------------------
<windup:java-classification source-type="INHERITANCE" regex="((com.ibm.websphere.startupservice.AppStartUpHome)|(com.ibm.websphere.startupservice.AppStartUp)|(com.ibm.websphere.startupservice.ModStartUpHome)|(com.ibm.websphere.startupservice.ModStartUp))$" description="Websphere Startup Service" effort="4">
    <windup:hints>
        <windup:java-hint regex="com.ibm.websphere.startupservice.AppStartUpHome" hint="Replace with EJB 3.1 @Singleton / @Startup annotations."/>
    </windup:hints>
    <windup:decorators>
        ...
    </windup:decorators>
</windup:java-classification>
-----------------------

Only in the case that this has been deemed to have the classification of a "Websphere Startup Service" will the hint be applied.  This hint will be added inline wherever the class `com.ibm.websphere.startupservice.AppStartUpHome` is used, and will add the hint to "Replace with EJB 3.1 @Singleton / @Startup annotations."
